## Commands to run the project
I written both client and server in TypeScript

* `npm install`, this will install both backend and frontend dependencies
* `npm start`, At the root `Fullstack folder` will start the backend server at port `http://localhost:4000`
* `npm start`, At the root `Frontend folder` will start the frontend app that servers at port `http://localhost:3000`

## Things I did well

* websocket communication between client and server
* Scheduling the bubble expiry and notify timeouts.
* Pause and Resume functionality of the game.
* Double Player Feature.
* Some unexpected state handling things at both frontend and backend.

## Things I didn't do well

* Generating a const number of bubbles only.
* Better UI features and Responsive.
* More clear documentation of the code.
